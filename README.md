# Description

A simple Pomodoro Chrome Extension built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This technique is used to improve productivity and focus by allowing you to work in short, focused bursts.
